I write this post in `jekyll` and this is my basic blog. Maybe in th further I will update the blog but for now it fit for my needs.

{% highlight rouge %}
print "hello world"
#=> prints 'hello world' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [My Github][My-Github] for more info on who I am and what I've done till now.
