								<h3>Website Design</h3>
								<p>The Web has made it easier than ever for new businesses to get started. No longer do companies need to establish a physical location for their business. Today, many companies operate solely online and their website is their "place of business". If you've never been involved in a new website project, one of the first questions you are likely to ask is "How much does a website cost?" Unfortunately, this question is impossible to answer unless you get much more specific.</p>
								<p>Our Pricing: $1,000 - $3,000</p>

								<h3>Website Hosting</h3>
								<p>A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center. Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for other servers located in their data center, called colocation, also known as Housing in Latin America or France.</p>
								<p>Our Pricing: $25 per month</p>
