					<p>
					My name is G.Z. , my specialty is on the Network and information security field, and now I'm on my way to the Cybersecurity area, which is for me all I want to do in the next years, so I build this web site to learn about HTML and CSS and JavaScript. To understand how the web work I was needed to learn all that I specified, and that is for understanding how attacks at the level of application and web works, attacks like: xss, csrf, sql injection and etc.
					</p>
					<p>
					My next level is to find so vulnerabilities and publish them to CVE, we all want the Internet will be better place to be in, by "better" I mean secure, so, to do so we need always that things work in the way they need and should to work.
					</p>
					<p>
					May God be with us all!
					</p>
					<p>Wish U the best!</p>

					<h3>What is white hat hacker</h3>
					<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)" style="color: rgb(0,210,0)">By Wikipedia:</a></b></p>
					<p>The term "white hat" in Internet slang refers to an ethical computer hacker, or a computer security expert, who specializes in penetration testing and in other testing methodologies to ensure the security of an organization's information systems. Ethical hacking is a term coined by IBM meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing. Contrasted with black hat, a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat respectively.</p>
