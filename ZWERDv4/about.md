My start point was in the ARMY, there I was involved in networking, my position was at WAN team and
I was responsible for security devices that proper to the ARMY.

The team responsible was on the WAN of the networks that the subunit was responsible for, every change or redesign
to the network was done only in WAN team by changes/redesign I mean to OSPF of static routing changing, re range tunnles and VPN, upgrade and update CISCO routers
and IOS FW's, configured from scratch new routers and devices that fit in the WAN layer, bring a solution for complex issue in the WAN layer etc.

after I finish the ARMY I start work at MOH in Network and Security team, and there is was more fun and I done the follow:
Setup from scratch CISCO and HP devices and configure them base on the MOH network needed,
work on NAC equipment of wise moon, manipulate devices like CheckPoint FW's, CyberARK vault, ODIX AV, PulseSecure VPN.

after 4 years I found new cool pales named BrightSource, there I was member of Network and Security Analists,
the Network was base on CISCO devices and more cool security equipment like NAC of ForeScout, y Symantec Endpoint Protection Managment,
Websense of Forcepoint,  Cisco IronPort, PulseSecure VPN, PaloAlto FW's, 2FA Symantec VIP and etc.

Now I am searching for the next challenge!

Mean wail I learning every thing that I can related to CyberSecuerity it's so freaking amazing and I love it so much!
I found very cool challenges on the net, I mean to Python or Javascript challenges and more security challenges...

Maybe some day I will start to write my one CVE that I will found.

In this blog I will post every tech that I found curious enough, maybe bring some cool solution for complex problems and such.

This is all for now.
