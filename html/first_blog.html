							 Hello every one, this is my first blog at my firs web site, so, congratulations to myself!
							 <br/>I think that because this is my first webpage that I develop by myself there is no beter place to tells my story.At the beginning I start my creer as Network technician at Israel Air Force,
							 after tree years I left the army and I find a job in Israel Ministry Of Healf,
							 I worked there four years as Network and Security engineer, in that job I was rensposible on wide range of network devices like Cisco and HP and as a security guy I
							 manage CyberArk vault and odix AV. I also helped to my team operating another security appliance like CheckPoint FW and wise-moon NAC and for one moment I found myself fascinated about the Security filed
							 and as the time passed I found myself with grater will to be an EXPERT in CyberSecurity area.
							 <br/>
							 <br/>
							 <br/>This app is about Nevi'im books, the second main division of the Hebrew Bible. The App contain riddles from the book "Abiha Hidot Meni Kedem" that was writing by dear brother David Zwerdling.
